## 1. 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Use as Template or Clone

Use this repo as a GitHub template (recommended), or clone it directly:

- `git clone https://github.com/robertlinde/next-nest-turbo-boilerplate.git`
- `cd next-nest-turbo-boilerplate`

### 2. Build Shared Package

Build the shared package so it can be installed as dependency for the apps:

- `cd packages/shared`
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install root-level dependencies (workspace-based):

- `npm install`

This will install dependencies for all apps using Turborepo's workspace management.

### 4. Setup Environment Variables

Each app has its own .env.example. Copy and configure them:

- `cp apps/nextjs-frontend/.env.example apps/nextjs-frontend/.env`
- `cp apps/nestjs-backend/.env.example apps/nestjs-backend/.env`

Then fill in the required environment variables based on your setup (e.g., database credentials, email service configs).

### 5. Start the Backend

Start the database container and apply migrations:

- `cd apps/nestjs-backend`
- `docker-compose up -d`
- `npm run migration:create`
- `npm run migration:up`

### 6. Start dev mode

At the root of your project, run:

- `npm run start:dev`

Your app should now be running with both frontend and backend services in development mode.
